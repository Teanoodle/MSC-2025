# MSC-2025 Problem A
StaircaseWear Analysis: Quantifying Usage, Behavioral Patterns,
and Preservation Insights Through Mathematical Modeling

# Summary
Staircases are not only an important component of historical buildings but also a significant medium
for studying human activity patterns and cultural inheritance. The uneven wear on their surfaces,
resulting from long-term use, records the behavioral patterns, load habits, and repair history of past
users. To scientifically explore the driving factors of staircase wear and its deep connection with human
activities, this paper comprehensively employs modern measurement techniques, data modeling, and
behavioral analysis to propose an innovative multi-level assessment framework, and reveals the characteristics
of staircase wear and the underlying human behavior information from multiple perspectives
